## About This Project

![myProfilePage](./assets/images/profilepage.png)

I worked on this project to practice flexbox, play with what I can do with pseudo-classes, and how to work with keyframes. I was able come up with and test many different aspects of how to format the site, practice with formatting different elements within their parent containers, and hit walls on what I was able to do. I did a LOT of googling, but I listed the sites that were fundamental to me making the site what it is. I know that I will have some further issues as I try to expand upon this project in the future, however I am very excited to try and make this site more usable and expand my knowledge more!

Originally I made my profile site completely differently that what it is now. I ended up moving the keyframes to the body of the site, to make it less straining on the eyes, I kept with lighter colors to avoid any accessablility issues.
From there I made my height and width measurements for everything that I could based on viewport heigth and width respectively- this allowed for a more responsive website. 
I bumped into the issue of overflow a few times, and my child elements going beyond the parent container. Playing around with overflow settings and border-sizing allowed me to clear through most of those issues. 
Towards the end I realized that I needed images as anchors, so I had to play around with my list items a bit to get the desired effects.
The pseudo-class hover was a blast to work with! I played with image sizes, text sizing, and opacity. There are a few more things I wish to play around with, but that might be for another time.
