                    I am passionate about learning. It's true! Be it about emerging technologies, the latest restaurants, or even meeting with and learning about total strangers. I love to learn. 
                    <br /><br />Presently, I manually test new features to ensure our product quality. I do this by reviewing project management methodologies like agile (scrum), going through Microsoft training, or playing with our API calls through Postman. 
                    <br />After work, I attend a Full-Stack Bootcamp that finishes in March 2022. 
                    <br /><br />Previously, I have worked (for many years) in the restaurant industry. You can pick a FOH - front of house job and I will tell you how it runs, things to look out for, tips & tricks, and even some industry secrets (Oh my!).  
                    <br />I have had experience in the cybersecurity industry as a Junior Engineer assisting in the NOC - Network Operations Center, and going off-site to our clients, ensuring both on and off-premise systems were meeting their security goals through wireshark, burp suite, and metasploit. 
                    <br /><br />In my spare time, I enjoy going to music concerts, exploring the world through scuba diving (on my way to get my Advanced Open Water), I even teaching yoga classes (RYT-200)! 
                    <br />So how did I end up being apart of all these wild and seemingly disconnected backgrounds/experiences? Well, for starters I was willing to listen to others, ask questions, and learn in my free time. For those whom I was fortunately able to met with on a regular basis, I would continue the conversation and ask even more! Over time, this led me to some pretty awesome experiences and some great laughs. The one common denominator to all aspects of my life: learning.
                    <br /><br />Skills: VMWare, VirtualBox, Cisco Meraki, OpenDNS, Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, ORM- Object Relational Mapping, MVC - Model Views Controllers, Agile Methodology, Azure DevOps, Jira, SharePoint, Project Online, PWA - Project for the Web.

I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Feel free to reach out to me if you wish to talk!
