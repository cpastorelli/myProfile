                    Hello there! My name is Caroline, and  I am currently attending the UCSD Extention bootcamp for Full-Stack Web Development. 
                    I am originally from the UK, however I moved to San Diego when I was a small child.
                    I have many loves in my life, from horror movies to rock concerts, pizza to sushi, and my dog Bowie, he is a 10 year old husky.
                    My favorite color is <span style="color:darkred" >dark red</span>. 
                    I love going on hikes, scuba diving, and baking desserts. My favorite holiday is Halloween. My favorite animal is a penguin (I find them to be so cute),
                    and I am afraid of anything that has more than 4 legs (Curse you spiders).  
                    I have travelled to Italy, England, Japan and Russia. An item on my bucket list is to see the Northern Lights. 
                </p>
